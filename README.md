# VLDN Feature Extraction from Video Frames

This project demonstrates how to extract VLDN (Variable Length Digits Notation) features from video frames. The VLDN features are computed for each frame in a video, and the results are saved to a CSV file for further analysis. This README provides an overview of the code and its usage.

## Overview

The code provided in this script includes the following steps:

1. Opening a CSV file to store the VLDN features.
2. Iterating through a range of video IDs (from 1 to 300).
3. For each video, processing a specified number of frames (in this case, 6 frames per video).
4. Reading and preprocessing each frame.
5. Calculating VLDN features for each frame using Kirsch masks.
6. Writing the computed VLDN features to the CSV file.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, ensure that you have:

1. Video frames stored in the "frames" directory, following the naming convention: "{video_id}_{frame_id}.jpg".
2. Python and OpenCV installed.
3. A CSV file ("VLDNFeatures.csv") created and opened for writing.

## Customization

You can customize the code to fit your specific requirements:

1. Adjust the range of video IDs and the number of frames processed per video.
2. Modify the path to the video frames directory and the CSV file.
3. Experiment with different image preprocessing techniques or feature extraction methods.

## Performance

The code processes each frame and calculates VLDN features, which represent the pixel intensity patterns in the frames. These features can be used for various applications, such as video analysis, object detection, or anomaly detection.

## Saving VLDN Features

The VLDN features are saved to a CSV file, which can be loaded and used for further analysis, machine learning, or visualization.

Please ensure that your video frames are correctly named and organized in the specified directory before running the code. If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to reach out for assistance.
