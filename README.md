# VLDN-Feature-Extraction-from-Video-Frames
This project demonstrates how to extract VLDN (Variable Length Digits Notation) features from video frames. The VLDN features are computed for each frame in a video, and the results are saved to a CSV file for further analysis. This README provides an overview of the code and its usage.
